# Chapter 2: Query Language

Chapters 2–4 are a complete reference on the GraphQL specification. If you're
done with Chapter 1 and want to get straight to coding, feel free to skip ahead
to Chapters 5 and 6 and refer back here when necessary 😊. If you have the time
and want a more thorough understanding, take it in order.

Chapter contents:

* [Document](2.md#document)
* [Fields](2.md#fields)
* [Arguments](2.md#arguments)
* [Fragments](2.md#fragments)
* [Variables](2.md#variables)
* [Directives](2.md#directives)
* [Mutations](2.md#mutations)
* [Subscriptions](2.md#subscriptions)

TODO write this chapter 😄. For now, linking to graphql.org

# Document

Similar to how we call a JSON file or string a JSON *document*, a GraphQL query file or string is called a GraphQL *query document*. The [GraphQL spec](http://facebook.github.io/graphql/October2016/#sec-Language.Query-Document) defines how to write a document:

A document is a list of one or more *operations* or [fragments](#fragments). An operation is either a `query`, [`mutation`](#mutations), or [`subscription`](#subscriptions). Our beginning examples are documents with a single `query` operation, like this:

```gql
query {
  githubStars
}
```

Our operation has a single root query [field](#fields), `githubStars`. In this type of document—a single `query` operation without [variables](#variables) or [directives](#directives)—we can omit `query`, so the above document is equivalent to:

```gql
{
  githubStars
}
```

A more complex document could be:

```gql
query StarsAndChapter {
  githubStars
  chapter(id: 0) {
    title
  }
}

subscription StarsSubscription {
  githubStars
}

mutation ViewedJavascriptSection {
  viewedSection(id: "0-1") {
    ...SectionData
  }
}

mutation ViewedGitSection {
  viewedSection(id: "0-2") {
    ...SectionData
  }
}

fragment SectionData on Section {
  id
  title
}
```

It has all the operation types as well as a fragment. Note that when we have more than one type of operation, we need to give them names—in this case, `StarsAndChapter`, `ViewedDocumentSection`, and `StarsSubscription`. 

The content between an operation's outer curly braces is called the *selection set*—the list of data fields we're requesting. For instance, the selection set of `StarsAndChapter` is:

```gql
{
  githubStars
  chapter(id: 0) {
    title
  }
}
```

We can think of the selection set as the left-hand side of a JSON document (with just the attributes), where the response will be the full JSON (with all the values filled in).
