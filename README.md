# The GraphQL Guide

This repo contains the text of The GraphQL Guide. 

## Supporting 

If you'd like to read the Guide, and if you can afford to purchase it or if your company reimburses you for educational materials (most do 👍), we would value your support: [https://graphql.guide](https://graphql.guide).

## Contributing

We welcome issues and PRs. For large changes, we recommend opening an issue first to get feedback before putting in the work of a PR. Minor things like typo fixes or suggested rewordings can go directly to PRs and will usually get a quick response.

### Setup

If you're working on gitbook-related issues or want to see how your PR will be formatted, follow these steps to get set up after cloning:

```sh
npm i -g gitbook
gitbook install
mkdir out/
```
