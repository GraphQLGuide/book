Thank you to everyone who has contributed 😃🙌

## Contributing

We welcome issues and PRs! For large changes, we recommend opening an issue first to get feedback before putting in the work of a PR. Minor things like typo fixes or suggested rewordings can go directly to PRs and will usually get a quick response 😊

### Formatting

- Use curly quotes (“ ‘ ’ ”) unless inside code blocks, in which case use straight quotes (' ")

### Setup

If you're working on gitbook-related issues or want to see how your PR will be formatted, follow these steps to get set up after cloning:

```sh
npm i -g gitbook-cli
gitbook install
mkdir out/
cd scripts
./build.sh
```
