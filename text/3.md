# Schema

The [schema](http://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Schema) describes the capabilities of a GraphQL server. It defines the possible queries, mutations, subscriptions, and additional types and directives. While the schema can be written in a programming language, it is often written in SDL (the GraphQL Schema Definition Language). Here is the most basic schema, written in SDL:

```gql
schema {
  query: Query
}

type Query {
  hello: String
}
```

It has a single root query field, `hello`, of type String (when we send a `hello` query, the server will return a string value). We can omit the `schema` declaration when we use operation types named `Query`, `Mutation`, and `Subscription`, so the above is equivalent to:

```gql
type Query {
  hello: String
}
```

With this schema, the client can make the below query:

```gql
query {
  hello
}
```

and receive this response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "hello": "world!"
  }
}
```

The root fields—those listed under `type Query { ... }`, `type Mutation { ... }`, and `type Subscription { ... }` are the entry points to our schema—the fields that can be selected by the client at the root level of an operation.

# Types

There are six *named types* and two *wrapping types*. The named types are:

- [Scalar](#scalars)
- [Enum](#enums)
- [Object](#objects)
- [Input object](#input-objects)
- [Interface](#interfaces)
- [Union](#unions)

If you think of a GraphQL query as a tree, starting at the root field and branching out, the leaves are either scalars or enums. They're the fields without selection sets of their own.

The two wrapping types are:

- [List](#lists)
- [Non-null](#non-null)

When the named types appear by themselves, they are singular and nullable—i.e., when the client requests a field, the server will either return one item or `null`. These two wrapping types change this.

# Descriptions

We can add a [description](http://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Descriptions) before any definition in our schema using `#`, `"`, or `"""`. Descriptions are included in [introspection](#introspection) and displayed by tools like GraphiQL.

```gql
type Query {
  # have the server say hello to whomever you want!
  hello(
    "person to say hello to"
    name: String!
  ): String
}

"""
multiline comment
describing 
the User type
"""
type User {
  id: Int
  email: String
}
```

# Scalars

[Scalars](http://graphql.org/learn/schema/#scalar-types) are primitive values. There are five included scalar types:

- `Int`: Signed 32-bit non-fractional number. Maximum value around 2 billion (2,147,483,647).
- `Float`: Signed [double-precision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format) (64-bit) fractional value.
- `String`: Sequence of [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) (8-bit Unicode) characters.
- `Boolean`: `true` or `false`.
- `ID`: Unique identifier, serialized as a string.

We can also define our own scalars, like `Url` and `DateTime`. In the description of our custom scalars, we write how they're serialized so the frontend developer knows what value to provide for arguments. For instance, `DateTime` could be serialized as an integer (milliseconds since [Epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_(computing))) or as an ISO string:

```gql
# schema
type Mutation {
  dayOfTheWeek(when: DateTime): String
}
```

```gql
# if DateTime is serialized as an integer
mutation {
  dayOfTheWeek(when: 1591028749941)
}

# if DateTime is serialized as an ISO string
mutation {
  dayOfTheWeek(when: "2020-06-01T16:25:49.941Z")
}
```

The benefits to using custom scalars are clarity (`when: DateTime` is clearer than `when: Int`) and consistent validation (whatever value we pass is checked to make sure its a valid DateTime).

We define our [own custom scalar](11.md#custom-scalars) in Chapter 11.

# Enums
 
When a scalar field has a small set of possible values, it's best to use an [enum](http://graphql.org/learn/schema/#enumeration-types) instead. The enum type declaration lists all the options:

```gql
enum Direction {
  NORTH
  EAST
  SOUTH
  WEST
}
```

Enums are usually serializes as strings (for example, `"NORTH"`). Here's an example Query type, query operation, and response:

```gql
type Query {
  currentHeading(flightId: ID): Direction
}
```

```gql
query {
  currentHeading(flightId: "abc")
}
```

```json
{
  "data": {
    "currentHeading": "NORTH"
  }
}
```

# Objects

An [object](http://graphql.org/learn/schema/#object-types-and-fields) is a list of fields, each of which have a name and a type. The below schema defines two object types, `Post` and `User`:

```gql
type Post {
  id: ID
  text: String
  author: User
}

type User {
  id: ID
  name: String
}
```

A field can have a type of anything but an input object. In the `Post` type, the `id` and `text` fields are scalars, while `author` is an object type. 

When selecting a field that has an object type, at least one of that object's fields must be selected. For instance in the below schema, `post` field is of type `Post`:

```gql
type Query {
  post(id: ID): Post
}
```

Since `Post` is an object type, at least one `Post` field must be selected in query A below—in this case, `text`. And in query B, `post.author` is of type `User`, so at least one `User` field must be selected.

```gql
query A {
  post(id: "abc") {
    text
  }
}

query B {
  post(id: "abc") {
    author {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

Or in other words, we have to keep adding selection sets until we only have leaves (scalars and enums) left. Objects are the branches on the way to the leaves.

# Interfaces

[Interfaces](http://graphql.org/learn/schema/#interfaces) define a list of fields that must be included in any object types implementing them. For instance, here are two interfaces, `BankAccount` and `InsuredAccount`, and and an object type that implements them, `CheckingAccount`:

```gql
interface BankAccount {
  accountNumber: String!
}

interface InsuredAccount {
  insuranceName: String
  insuranceAmount: Int!
}

type CheckingAccount implements BankAccount & InsuredAccount {
  accountNumber: String!
  insuranceName: String
  insuranceAmount: Int!
  routingNumber: String!
}
```

Since `CheckingAccount` implements both interfaces, it must include the fields from both. It can also include additional fields, like `routingNumber`.

Interfaces can also implement other interfaces, like this:

```gql
interface InvestmentAccount implements BankAccount {
  accountNumber: String!
  marginApproved: Boolean!
}

type RetirementAccount implements InvestmentAccount {
  accountNumber: String!
  marginApproved: Boolean!
  contributionLimit: Int!
}
```

Interfaces are helpful for clarity and consistency in the schema, but they're also useful as field types:

```gql
type Query {
  user(id: ID!): User
}

type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  accounts: [BankAccount]
}
```

We can now query for fields in `BankAccount`

```gql
query {
  user(id: "abc") {
    name 
    accounts {
      accountNumber: String!      
    }
  }
}
```

And if we want to query fields outside `BankAccount`, we can use a fragment:

```gql
query {
  user(id: "abc") {
    name 
    accounts {
      accountNumber: String!
      ... on RetirementAccount {
        marginApproved
        contributionLimit
      }
    }
  }
}
```

# Unions

A [union](http://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Unions) type is defined as a list of object types:

```gql
union SearchResult = User | Post

type User {
  name: String
  profilePic: Url
}

type Post {
  text: String
  upvotes: Int
}
```

When a field is typed as a union, its value can be any of the objects listed in the union definition. So the below `search` query returns a list of `User` and `Post` objects.

```gql
type Query {
  search(term: String): SearchResult
}
```

```gql
query {
  search(term: "John") {
    ... on User {
      name
    }
    ... on Post {
      text
    }
  }
}
```

Since unions don't guarantee any fields in common, any field we select has to be inside a fragment (which have a specific object type).

# Lists

[List](http://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Type-System.List) is a *wrapper type*. It wraps another type and signifies an ordered list in which each item is of the other type.

```gql
type User {
  names: [String]
}
```

The `User.names` field could be any of these values:

```json
null
[]
[null]
["Loren"]
["Loren", null, "L", "Lolo"]
```

We can also nest lists, like `Spreadsheet.cells`:

```gql
type Spreadsheet {
  columns: [String]
  rows: [String]
  cells: [[Int]]
}
```

For example:

```json
{
  "columns": ["Revenue", "Expenses"],
  "rows": ["Jan", "Feb", "March"],
  "cells": [[100, 110], [200, 100], [300, 50]]
}
```

# Non-null

[Non-null](http://graphql.org/learn/schema/#lists-and-non-null) is a *wrapper type*. It wraps any other type and signifies that type can't be null.

```gql
type User {
  name: String!
}
```

If we select `User.name` in a query:

```gql
query {
  user(id: "abc") {
    name
  }
}
```

then we will never get this response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "name": null
    }
  }
}
```

These two responses are valid:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "name": "Loren"
    }
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "data": {
    "user": null
  }
}
```

When there are multiple levels of non-null, the null propagates upward. We'll see an example of this in [Chapter 4: Errors](4.md#errors).

# Field arguments

Any field can accept a named, unordered list of [arguments]. Arguments can be scalars, enums, or *input objects*. An argument can be non-null to indicate it is required. Optional arguments can have a default value, like `name` below.

```gql
type User {
  # no arguments
  name

  # an optional scalar argument with a default value
  profilePic(width: Int = 100): Url
}

type Mutation {
  # a non-null enum argument
  pokemonGo(direction: Direction!): Boolean

  # three non-null scalar arguments
  createPost(authorId: ID!, title: String!, body: String!): Post
}
```

## Input objects

[Input objects](http://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Input-Objects) are objects that are only used as arguments. An input object is often the sole argument to mutations (see [Chapter 11: Schema design > Mutations > Arguments](11.md#arguments)). 

An input object is a list of input fields—scalars, enums, and other input objects.

```gql
type Mutation {
  createPost(input: CreatePostInput!): Post
}

input CreatePostInput {
  authorId: ID!
  title: String = "Untitled"
  body: String!
}
```

Note that:

- Input object fields can have default values.
- The declaration keyword is `input`, not the `type` keyword that is used for output objects..

# Directives

We talked about the query side of [directives](http://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Type-System.Directives) in [Chapter 2: Directives](2.md#directives). Directives are declared in the schema. A directive definition includes its name, any arguments, on what types of locations it can be used, and whether it's repeatable (used multiple times on the same location):

```gql
directive @authoredBy(name: String!) repeatable on OBJECT

type Book @authoredBy(name: "pageCount") @authoredBy(name: "author") {
  id: ID!
}
```

The locations can either be in [executable documents](2.md#document) or [schema documents](2.md#document).

```gql
# Executable locations
QUERY
MUTATION
SUBSCRIPTION
FIELD
FRAGMENT_DEFINITION
FRAGMENT_SPREAD
INLINE_FRAGMENT
VARIABLE_DEFINITION

# Schema locations
SCHEMA
SCALAR
OBJECT
FIELD_DEFINITION
ARGUMENT_DEFINITION
INTERFACE
UNION
ENUM
ENUM_VALUE
INPUT_OBJECT
INPUT_FIELD_DEFINITION
```

Directives can work on multiple locations, like `@deprecated`:

```
directive @deprecated(
  reason: String = "No longer supported"
) on FIELD_DEFINITION | ENUM_VALUE

type Direction {
  NORTHWEST @deprecated
  NORTH
  EAST
  SOUTH
  WEST
}

type User {
  id: Int!
  name: String
  fullName: String @deprecated("Use `name` instead")
}
```

# Extending

All named types can be [extended](http://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Type-System-Extensions) in some way. We might use extensions when using documents across multiple files to define our schema, or if we're modifying a schema defined by someone else. Here are a couple examples: 

```gql
extend type Query {
  newClientWhoDis: String
}

extend enum Direction {
  SOUTHEAST
  SOUTHWEST
  NORTHEAST
  NORTHWEST
}
```

First we add a root query field, and then we add four more possible values for the `Direction` enum.

# Introspection

GraphQL servers support [introspection](http://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Introspection)—the ability to query for information about the server's schema. There are three introspection entry fields:

- `__schema: __Schema!`
- `__type(name: String!): __Type`
- `__typename: String`

The first two are root query fields, and `__typename` is an implicit field on all objects, interfaces, and unions. We can use `__typename` in the search query from the [Interfaces section](#interfaces):

```gql
query {
  search(term: "John") {
    __typename
    ... on User {
      name
    }
    ... on Post {
      text
    }
  }
}
```

And the response will include the name of the result object's type:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "search": {
      "__typename": "Post",
      "text": "John Resig joins Khan Academy to provide free education to everyone."
    }
  }
}
```

With the introspection root query fields we can either get information about a single type (like the below query) or all types (via `query { __schema { types { ... } } }`).

```gql
query {
  __type(name: "User") {
    name
    fields {
      name
      type {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "__type": {
    "name": "User",
    "fields": [
      {
        "name": "id",
        "type": { "name": "ID" }
      },
      {
        "name": "name",
        "type": { "name": "String" }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

As we can see, the response shows all the information in the schema about a `User`:

```gql
type User {
  id: ID
  email: String
}
```

Here is the full [introspection schema](http://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Schema-Introspection):

```gql
extend type Query {
  __schema: __Schema!
  __type(name: String!): __Type  
}
