GraphQL can be used between any two computers, such as from a web browser to a server or between two servers. Any computer with a network
connection can send a GraphQL request, and any computer with an IP address on
that network can receive that request and send back a response. Most software
written these days follows the
[client–server model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model),
in which one computer is always providing a service (a **server**), and another
computer is always requesting the service (a **client**, such as a web browser or mobile app). In a GraphQL client–server model, the client
makes GraphQL requests, and the server provides the service of responding to
those requests. We’ll code GraphQL clients in the next few chapters and a GraphQL server
in the [last](11.md).

First we’ll make simple HTTP requests, which we can do from any computer. Most
application clients are web browsers or mobile apps, so after HTTP,
we’ll use the best web and mobile GraphQL libraries to create full-featured
clients. The two web view layers we’ll be covering are React and Vue, and
we’ll use their most popular GraphQL libraries, which are
[`react-apollo`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) and
[`vue-apollo`](https://github.com/akryum/vue-apollo#table-of-contents/). The best mobile
libraries are [`Apollo iOS`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/),
[`Apollo-Android`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android), and
[`react-apollo`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) for React
Native.

For each type of client and the server, the app we’ll go through building is
[graphql.guide](https://graphql.guide/Preface)—a web or mobile app for reading the
GraphQL Guide.

# Anywhere: HTTP

Background: [HTTP](bg.md#http), [JSON](bg.md#json)

Whether we’re writing Javascript for a website, Swift for an iPhone, C for a
microcontroller, etc., we can make a connection to a server and send an
[HTTP request](bg.md#http). At its base, a GraphQL request is just an HTTP POST
request.

## cURL

When we’re on the command line, we can use
[cURL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL) (“See URL”, a tool for making network
requests, including HTTP requests):

```sh
$ curl -X POST \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"query": "{ githubStars }"}' \
https://api.graphql.guide/graphql
```

* `-X` specifies which HTTP method to use—in this case POST
* `\` continues the command on the next line
* `-H` sets an HTTP header—in this case the
  [`Content-Type`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Type)
  header (where we specify the
  [MIME type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type) of the request body) to
  `application/json`
* `-d` sets the body of the request—in this case to our [JSON](bg.md#json) query: `{"query":
  "{ githubStars }"}`

`curl` prints the response to the command line:

```json
{"data":{"githubStars":1337}}
```

When talking about GraphQL, we usually skip over:

* the `{"query": "X"}` part of the request body
* the `{"data":Y}` part of the JSON response

Instead we just talk about:

* `X`, the GraphQL [document](1.md#document): `{ githubStars }`
* `Y`, the value of the `"data"` attribute: `{"githubStars":1337}`

## Javascript

In a browser, we can use
[`fetch()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)
to make HTTP requests:

```js
const makeGraphqlRequest = async ({ endpoint, document }) => {
  const options = {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: new Headers({
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }),
    body: JSON.stringify({
      query: document
    })
  }

  const response = await fetch(endpoint, options)
  return response.json()
}

const logStars = async () => {
  const response = await makeGraphqlRequest({
    endpoint: 'https://api.graphql.guide/graphql',
    document: '{ githubStars }'
  })

  console.log(response)
}
```

<a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/hukazic/embed?js,console">Run in browser</a>

Just as we did with cURL, we make an HTTP POST request to our endpoint url with
a Content-Type header and a JSON body. Running `logStars()` prints this to the console:

```json
{
  data: {
    githubStars: 1337
  }
}
```

We can do the same thing in other languages by using their HTTP request
functions with equivalent parameters.

For our in-browser Javascript example, instead of logging the data, we can
display it on the page:

```js
const displayStars = async () => {
  const response = await makeGraphqlRequest({
    endpoint: 'https://api.graphql.guide/graphql', 
    document: '{ githubStars }'
  })
  const starCount = response.data.githubStars
  const el = document.getElementById('github-stars')
  el.innerText = `The Guide has ${starCount} stars on GitHub!`
}

displayStars()
```

[Run in browser](https://codesandbox.io/s/m322q18958?module=%2Fsrc%2Findex.js)

This method of displaying data (finding a DOM node with `document.getElementById` or `document.querySelector` and setting its `innerText`) is straightforward and great for simple tasks. However, most web apps we build are complex enough that they benefit greatly
from a user interface library like React—in the [next chapter](6.md), we’ll learn
the best way to put GraphQL data into our React components.

# Client libraries

There are many different GraphQL client libraries for different platforms and
languages. Here is some common functionality that the libraries might provide:

- [Streamlined request function](#streamlined-request-function)
- [Typing](#typing)
- [View layer integration](#view-layer-integration)
- [Caching](#caching)
- [DevTools](#devtools)

The first is useful anywhere—whether it’s a script, service, or website that’s mostly static (only displays a small amount of dynamically fetched data). The second is useful when we’re working in a typed programming language. The last three are extremely helpful for building applications: whether we’re making a web app, a mobile app, or a desktop app, we usually need to fetch and display a number of different types of data from the server, and decide which to fetch and display based on user interactions. We also want to remember what we requested in the past, because often when we need to display it again, we don’t need to fetch it again. Doing all of this ourselves can get really complicated, but advanced client libraries like Apollo can take care of a lot of it for us.

## Streamlined request function

The most basic thing a library does is give us something like the
[`makeGraphqlRequest()`](#javascript) function we wrote above, which takes care
of constructing the HTTP POST request and parsing the response. For instance, the [`graphql-request`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-request) client library does this (and only this).

## Typing

When we’re working in typed languages, we have to write our own object types and models, and when we get JSON from a REST API, we have to convert the data into our types. With GraphQL, we know the types for everything because they’re in the schema. Which means that our client libraries can provide us with type definitions or generate typed model code for us. For instance, [`apollo-codegen`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-codegen) generates type definitions for Typescript, Flow, and Scala, [Apollo iOS](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/) returns query-specific Swift types, and [Apollo-Android](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android) generates typed Java models based on our queries and schema.

A combination of having a schema and query documents also allow for some great code editor features, such as autocomplete, go to definition, and schema validation. (See for example the [VS Code plugin](https://github.com/apollographql/vscode-graphql) and [IntelliJ/WebStorm plugin](https://github.com/jimkyndemeyer/js-graphql-intellij-plugin).)

## View layer integration

Most libraries even take care of calling `makeGraphqlRequest` for us: we simply add
our query documents to the components that need them, and when those components
are rendered, the documents get combined into a request to the server. When we
get data back from a GraphQL server, we usually want to display it to the user—and depending on the view layer, our library may have handy ways of helping us
do that, as well as handling loading state and errors. We’ll see some specific examples of this in the [React](6.md), [React Native](8.md), and [Vue](7.md) sections.

## Caching

> Background: [latency](bg.md#latency)

All of the libraries we’ll use cache the data we get from the GraphQL
server—that is, they store the data, either in memory or on disk, so that we can
immediately access it later without having to request it again from the server.
While some libraries just cache the whole response and give us the cached
response when we make the exact same request, the most useful libraries store
the data in a **normalized** cache. A normalized cache breaks down the response
and saves each object separately, so that if we make a different, overlapping
query, the library can still give us the cached data. As an example, let’s
consider this part of the schema of the Guide:

```gql
type Query {
  currentUser: User
  section(id: Int!): Section
}

type User {
  firstName: String
  hasRead: [Section]
}

type Section {
  title: String!
}
```

When a user visits their profile, we want to show a list of which sections
they’ve read, so we send this query:

```gql
{
  currentUser {
    id
    firstName
    hasRead {
      id
      title
    }
  }
}
```

Our query returns:

```json
{
  "currentUser": {
    "id": "1",
    "firstName": "Loren",
    "hasRead": [
      {
        "id": "5_1",
        "title": "Anywhere: HTTP"
      },
      {
        "id": "5_2",
        "title": "Client Libraries"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

And our library saves the response in a normalized cache. The key to each object
in the cache is a string of the format `"[type]:[object id]"`, for instance
`"User:1"` for a User object with an id of 1:

```js
cache = {
  "User:1": {
    id: "1",
    firstName: "Loren",
    hasRead: [
      "Section:5_1",
      "Section:5_2"
    ]
  },
  "Section:5_1": {
    id: "5_1",
    title: "Anywhere: HTTP"
  },
  "Section:5_2": {
    id: "5_2",
    title: "Client Libraries"
  }
}
```

If the user then navigates to section `5_2`, we want to display the title of
that section, so we look it up with this query:

```gql
{
  section(id: "5_2") {
    title
  }
}
```

Which should return:

```json
{
  "section": {
    "title": "Client Libraries"
  }
}
```

But we already know from our first query that `"Client Libraries"` is the title.
Our normalized caching library, instead of sending our second query to the
server, can find the object with the `"Section:5_2"` key in the cache and
immediately return it to us.

Sometimes we want to re-request data from the server, because it may have
changed since we originally requested it. Client libraries certainly allow
us to re-request, but we usually want to immediately display the cached data
while we wait for the response to arrive. The time it takes to get a value from
the cache and display it on the screen could be as little as 20ms, whereas
common response times from GraphQL servers are on the order of hundreds of
milliseconds or seconds, depending on the user’s network connection [latency](bg.md#latency) and
how long the server takes to retrieve their data. Humans
[perceive delays](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rail)
above 100ms, so UX best practice is to show something on the screen within 100ms
of a user action. We probably won’t get a response from our GraphQL server in
time, so we’ll want to either communicate that we’re waiting—for example by
displaying a spinner—or display the cached version of the data.

## DevTools

Some libraries have browser DevTools extensions for viewing information about an app’s GraphQL operations and the current state of the store. Apollo’s DevTools also has a built-in GraphiQL that uses the same network link as our app, so we don’t have to manually set authentication headers. We can even use it to query the store instead of the server by checking “Load from cache”:

![DevTools GraphiQL](img/devtools-graphiql.png)

Under the Queries tab, we see the current “Watched queries” (queries attached to our components) and what variables they were called with:

![DevTools Query](img/devtools-query.png)

Under the Mutations tab, we see a log of all past mutations and their variables:

![DevTools Mutation](img/devtools-ViewedMutation.png)

Under the Cache tab, we see the current state of the store/cache. Normalized data objects (any objects for which the `id` was requested) are listed on the left and appear in expandable `<details>` nodes on the right:
