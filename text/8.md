Background: [Mobile apps](bg.md#mobile-apps), [React Native](bg.md#react-native)

In this chapter, we'll build a universal React Native app with Expo. (For more on React Native, *universal* apps, and Expo, check out the [background section](bg.md#react-native).) We'll use the same Apollo Client library and API that we used in the extensive [React chapter](6.md), so for most things, refer to that chapter. Here, we'll just get a small example of writing and running a React Native app with a couple screens and GraphQL queries. The app will display the table of contents of the Guideâ€”the home screen will display the chapters, and selecting a chapter will display a list of its sections.

# App structure

We start with a basic Expo app:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/GraphQLGuide/guide-react-native.git
cd guide-react-native/
git checkout 0_0.1.0
npm install
npm start
```

`npm start` runs `expo start`, which starts the Expo bundler and displays a number of ways to start the app, either from the terminal or from the "Metro Bundler" website that's opened.

![Expo running in the terminal](/img/expo-terminal.png)

Here's the app running on iOS:

![Screenshot of the app on an iOS device](/img/expo-iOS.png)

and on an Android simulator:

![Screenshot of the app on an Android simulator](/img/expo-android.png)

and as a web app:

![Screenshot of the app in Chrome](/img/expo-web.png)

Here's our code structure:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â”œâ”€â”€ App.js
â”œâ”€â”€ app.json
â”œâ”€â”€ assets
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ favicon.png
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ icon.png
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ splash.png
â”œâ”€â”€ babel.config.js
â”œâ”€â”€ package-lock.json
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ src
    â”œâ”€â”€ HomeScreen.js
    â”œâ”€â”€ Loading.js
    â””â”€â”€ styles.js
```

[`app.json`](https://github.com/GraphQLGuide/guide-react-native/blob/0_0.1.0/app.json) has Expo configuration:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "guide",
    "slug": "guide",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "orientation": "portrait",
    "icon": "./assets/icon.png",
    "splash": {
      "image": "./assets/splash.png",
      "resizeMode": "cover",
      "backgroundColor": "#ffffff"
    },
    "updates": {
      "fallbackToCacheTimeout": 0
    },
    "assetBundlePatterns": ["**/*"],
    "ios": {
      "supportsTablet": true
    },
    "web": {
      "favicon": "./assets/favicon.png"
    }
  }
}
```

It points to images in the `assets/` folder for the app icon, the splash screen (full-screen image shown while the app is loading), and the website favicon.

[`babel.config.js`](https://github.com/GraphQLGuide/guide-react-native/blob/0_0.1.0/babel.config.js) allows us to configure Babel. It's currently using the default preset:

```js
module.exports = function (api) {
  api.cache(true)
  return {
    presets: ['babel-preset-expo'],
  }
}
```

Our JavaScript code is in these files:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ App.js
â””â”€â”€ src
    â”œâ”€â”€ HomeScreen.js
    â”œâ”€â”€ Loading.js
    â””â”€â”€ styles.js
```

[`App.js`](https://github.com/GraphQLGuide/guide-react-native/blob/0_0.1.0/App.js) is the app's entry point. It sets up navigation with the [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) library and sets the mobile status bar icons to light/white (against the pink header):

```js
import React from 'react'
import { StatusBar } from 'expo-status-bar'
import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native'
import { createStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/stack'

import HomeScreen from './src/HomeScreen'
import { screenOptions } from './src/styles'

const Stack = createStackNavigator()

export default function App() {
  return (
    <NavigationContainer>
      <Stack.Navigator initialRouteName="Home" screenOptions={screenOptions}>
        <Stack.Screen
          name="Home"
          component={HomeScreen}
          options={{ title: 'ðŸ“– The GraphQL Guide' }}
        />
      </Stack.Navigator>
      <StatusBar style="light" />
    </NavigationContainer>
  )
}
```

`src/Homescreen.js` just displays `<Loading />` for now:

```js
import React from 'react'

import Loading from './Loading'

export default () => {
  return <Loading />
}
```

[`src/Loading.js`](https://github.com/GraphQLGuide/guide-react-native/blob/0_0.1.0/src/Loading.js) uses the native `ActivityIndicator` spinner:

```js
import React from 'react'
import { View, ActivityIndicator } from 'react-native'

import styles, { PINK } from './styles'

export default () => (
  <View style={styles.centered}>
    <ActivityIndicator size="large" color={PINK} />
  </View>
)
```

And [`src/styles.js`](https://github.com/GraphQLGuide/guide-react-native/blob/0_0.1.0/src/styles.js) contains our styling:

```js
import { StyleSheet } from 'react-native'

export const PINK = '#ff5dc8'

export const screenOptions = {
  headerStyle: {
    backgroundColor: PINK,
  },
  headerTintColor: '#fff',
}

export default StyleSheet.create({
  centered: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  item: {
    paddingTop: 16,
    paddingBottom: 16,
    paddingLeft: 20,
    paddingRight: 20,
    borderBottomWidth: 1,
    borderBottomColor: '#cccccc',
  },
  header: {
    fontWeight: 'bold',
  },
  subheader: {
    paddingTop: 10,
  },
})
```

# Adding Apollo

> If youâ€™re jumping in here, `git checkout 0_0.1.0` (tag [0_0.1.0](https://github.com/GraphQLGuide/guide/tree/0_0.1.0), or compare [0...1](https://github.com/GraphQLGuide/guide/compare/0_0.1.0...1_0.1.0))

Just like we did the React chapter, we create a client instance and wrap our app in an `<ApolloProvider>`:

[`App.js`](https://github.com/GraphQLGuide/guide-react-native/blob/1_0.1.0/App.js)

```js
import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache, ApolloProvider } from '@apollo/client'

const client = new ApolloClient({
  uri: 'https://api.graphql.guide/graphql',
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
})

export default function App() {
  return (
    <ApolloProvider client={client}>
      <NavigationContainer>
        ...
      </NavigationContainer>
    </ApolloProvider>
  )
}
```

Now in our `HomeScreen` component, we can make a query for the chapter list and display it:

[`src/HomeScreen.js`](https://github.com/GraphQLGuide/guide-react-native/blob/1_0.1.0/src/HomeScreen.js)

```js
import { Text, FlatList, Pressable } from 'react-native'
import { gql, useQuery } from '@apollo/client'

import styles from './styles'

const CHAPTERS_QUERY = gql`
  query Chapters {
    chapters {
      id
      number
      title
    }
  }
`

const ChapterItem = ({ chapter }) => {
  const { number, title } = chapter
  let header, subheader

  if (number) {
    header = `Chapter ${number}`
    subheader = title
  } else {
    header = title
  }

  return (
    <Pressable style={styles.item}>
      <Text style={styles.header}>{header}</Text>
      {subheader && <Text style={styles.subheader}>{subheader}</Text>}
    </Pressable>
  )
}

export default () => {
  const { data, loading } = useQuery(CHAPTERS_QUERY)

  if (loading) {
    return <Loading />
  }

  return (
    <FlatList
      data={data.chapters}
      renderItem={({ item }) => (
        <ChapterItem chapter={item} />
      )}
      keyExtractor={(chapter) => chapter.id.toString()}
    />
  )
}
```

[FlatList](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flatlist.html) is a core React Native component for displaying lists. `renderItem` is called to render each item in the `data` array prop, and `keyExtractor` returns a unique string to use for each item's `key` prop.

When we edit our code with the app open, it live reloads. However, the query gets stuck in a loading state, so we just see the spinner. To do a full reload, open the developer menu and select "Reload."

How to open the developer menu:

- iOS Device: Shake the device a little bit.
- iOS Simulator: Hit `Ctrl+Cmd+Z` on a Mac in the emulator to simulate the shake gesture, or press `Cmd+D`.
- Android Device: Shake the device vertically a little bit.
- Android Emulator: Either hit `Cmd+M`, or run `adb shell input keyevent 82` in your terminal window.

When we do a full reload, we briefly see the loading indicator, and then:

# Adding a screen

> If youâ€™re jumping in here, `git checkout 1_0.1.0` (tag [1_0.1.0](https://github.com/GraphQLGuide/guide/tree/1_0.1.0), or compare [1...2](https://github.com/GraphQLGuide/guide/compare/1_0.1.0...2_0.1.0))

When the user taps a chapter, let's take them to a new screen that shows a list of sections. While we could edit `CHAPTERS_QUERY` to select `chapters.sections` and pass the list of sections to the next screen, let's instead pass just the chapter info and have the next screen make a separate query for the sections.

To start, we add another screenâ€”`ChapterScreen`â€”to the navigation:

[`App.js`](https://github.com/GraphQLGuide/guide-react-native/blob/2_0.1.0/App.js)

```js
import ChapterScreen from './src/ChapterScreen'

export default function App() {
  return (
    <ApolloProvider client={client}>
      <NavigationContainer>
        <Stack.Navigator initialRouteName="Home" screenOptions={screenOptions}>
          <Stack.Screen
            name="Home"
            component={HomeScreen}
            options={{ title: 'ðŸ“– The GraphQL Guide' }}
          />
          <Stack.Screen
            name="Chapter"
            component={ChapterScreen}
            options={({
              route: {
                params: {
                  chapter: { number, title },
                },
              },
            }) => ({
              title: number ? `Chapter ${number}: ${title}` : title,
            })}
          />
        </Stack.Navigator>
        <StatusBar style="light" />
      </NavigationContainer>
    </ApolloProvider>
  )
}
```

If the chapter has a number, we include "Chapter N: " in the title. The `options` function assumes that when we navigate to the `"Chapter"` screen, we pass a `chapter` param. Let's do that:

[`src/HomeScreen.js`](https://github.com/GraphQLGuide/guide-react-native/blob/2_0.1.0/src/HomeScreen.js)

```js
const ChapterItem = ({ chapter, onPress }) => {
  ...

  return (
    <Pressable style={styles.item} onPress={onPress}>
      <Text style={styles.header}>{header}</Text>
      {subheader && <Text style={styles.subheader}>{subheader}</Text>}
    </Pressable>
  )
}

export default ({ navigation }) => {
  ...

  return (
    <FlatList
      data={data.chapters}
      renderItem={({ item }) => (
        <ChapterItem
          chapter={item}
          onPress={() => navigation.navigate('Chapter', { chapter: item })}
        />
      )}
      keyExtractor={(chapter) => chapter.id.toString()}
    />
  )
}
```

Each screen gets a `navigation` prop provided by `react-navigation`. When a chapter is pressed, we call `navigation.navigate()`, passing the chapter object as a param.

Now for the `ChapterScreen`:

[`src/ChapterScreen.js`](https://github.com/GraphQLGuide/guide-react-native/blob/2_0.1.0/src/ChapterScreen.js)

```js
import React from 'react'
import { View, Text, FlatList } from 'react-native'
import { gql, useQuery } from '@apollo/client'

import styles from './styles'
import Loading from './Loading'

const SECTIONS_QUERY = gql`
  query Sections($id: Int!) {
    chapter(id: $id) {
      sections {
        number
        title
      }
    }
  }
`

const SectionItem = ({ section, chapter }) => (
  <View style={styles.item}>
    <Text style={styles.header}>
      {chapter.number}.{section.number}: {section.title}
    </Text>
  </View>
)

export default ({ route }) => {
  const { data, loading } = useQuery(SECTIONS_QUERY, {
    variables: { id: route.params.chapter.id },
  })

  if (loading) {
    return <Loading />
  }

  const {
    chapter: { sections },
  } = data

  if (sections.length === 1) {
    return (
      <View style={styles.centered}>
        <Text>No sections</Text>
      </View>
    )
  }

  return (
    <FlatList
      data={sections}
      renderItem={({ item }) => (
        <SectionItem section={item} chapter={route.params.chapter} />
      )}
      keyExtractor={(section) => section.number.toString()}
      initialNumToRender={15}
    />
  )
}
```

Each screen gets a `route` prop that contains the params. Now we can go back and forth between the home screen and individual chapter screens:

![Screen with "Chapter 2: Query Language" title and a list of sections](/img/expo-section-list.png)

One further change we can make that is often a UX improvement is keeping the splash screen up until the home screen's data is ready, so the user doesn't see a flash of empty-page-with-spinner. We can do this by replacing our `<Loading>` component with Expo's `<AppLoading>`:

[`src/HomeScreen.js`](https://github.com/GraphQLGuide/guide-react-native/blob/2_0.1.0/src/HomeScreen.js)

```js
import { AppLoading } from 'expo'

export default ({ navigation }) => {
  const { data, loading } = useQuery(CHAPTERS_QUERY)

  if (loading) {
    return <AppLoading />
  }

  ...
```

Now the user should be taken straight from seeing this:

![Splash screen: Guide logo on white background](/img/expo-splash.png)

to seeing this:

![Home screen with chapter list](/img/expo-home-screen.png)

# Persisting

> If youâ€™re jumping in here, `git checkout 2_0.1.0` (tag [2_0.1.0](https://github.com/GraphQLGuide/guide/tree/2_0.1.0), or compare [2...3](https://github.com/GraphQLGuide/guide/compare/2_0.1.0...3_0.1.0))

While most aspects of using Apollo Client are the same between React and React Native, one thing that's different is that React Native doesn't have a global `window` variable. For example, [Chapter 6 > REST](6.md#rest) we used `window.navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition()`. Running that code in React Native would throw an error. Instead, we would use `Location.getCurrentPositionAsync()` from the [`expo-location`](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v39.0.0/sdk/location/#locationgetcurrentpositionasyncoptions) package.

We also used `window` in [Chapter 6 > Persisting](6.md#persisting):

```js
persistCache({
  cache,
  storage: window.localStorage,
})
```

We can substitute `window.localStorage` with `AsyncStorage` from [`@react-native-community/async-storage`](https://react-native-community.github.io/async-storage/), and we can use `<AppLoading />` to keep the splash screen up until `persistCache()` has completed:

[`App.js`](https://github.com/GraphQLGuide/guide-react-native/blob/3_0.1.0/App.js)

```js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-community/async-storage'
import { persistCache } from 'apollo3-cache-persist'
import { AppLoading } from 'expo'

const cache = new InMemoryCache()

const client = new ApolloClient({
  uri: 'https://api.graphql.guide/graphql',
  cache,
})

export default function App() {
  const [loadingCache, setLoadingCache] = useState(true)

  useEffect(() => {
    persistCache({
      cache,
      storage: AsyncStorage,
    }).then(() => setLoadingCache(false))
  }, [])

  if (loadingCache) {
    return <AppLoading />
  }

  return (
    <ApolloProvider client={client}>
      ...
    </ApolloProvider>
  )
}
```

Now when we navigate to a chapter, reload the app, and navigate to the same chapter, we won't see a spinner. The app will also display the home screen sooner, since it's just waiting for the cached data to be read from `AsyncStorage`, instead of waiting for the data from the server.

The last thing we probably want to update is the Apollo fetch policy. It defaults to `cache-first`: first looking for the data in the cache, and if it's not there, fetching from the server. With a persisted cache, after the first time the data is queried, the data will always be there, so we'll never again fetch from the server. The problem is that if the data ever changes on the server, the app will never get the new data. In our case, the chapter or section lists may change, and we want the user to get the most recent version. We can set the fetch policy to `cache-and-network` to both return data from the cache *and* from the network (if the network data is different). We can set the policy either in individual queries (in the second argument to `useQuery()`) or set a new default for all queries:

[`App.js`](https://github.com/GraphQLGuide/guide-react-native/blob/3_0.1.0/App.js)

```js
const client = new ApolloClient({
  uri: 'https://api.graphql.guide/graphql',
  cache,
  defaultOptions: { watchQuery: { fetchPolicy: 'cache-and-network' } },
})
```

# Deploying

> If youâ€™re jumping in here, `git checkout 3_0.1.0` (tag [3_0.1.0](https://github.com/GraphQLGuide/guide/tree/3_0.1.0)

Deploying an [SPA](bg.md#spa) is straightforward: 

- The build tool outputs an HTML file, a JS file (or multiple if we're code splitting), and other static assets, like CSS files, images, and fonts.
- We put those files on the cloud service that our domain points to. If we're using GitHub Pages, we do so with a `git push`, with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) it's `cd build/ && vercel`, and with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) it's `netlify deploy`.

Deploying native apps is much more involved. Fortunately, Expo does a lot to make the process smoother. First, we optimize our assets (for example, compressing images):

```sh
npm i -g sharp-cli
npx expo-optimize
```

The next step is building, but before we do that, we need to add some fields to our `app.json`:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    ...
    "primaryColor": "#ff5dc8",
    "ios": {
      "bundleIdentifier": "com.example.appname",
      "buildNumber": "1.0.0",
      "supportsTablet": true
    },
    "android": {
      "package": "com.example.appname",
      "versionCode": 1,
      "permissions": []
    }
  }
}
```

The first digit of an iOS build number cannot be 0, so the lowest number possible is `1.0.0`. 

On Android, permissions are requested at time of install (versus iOS, which are requested via popup dialogs while the app is being used). `android.permissions` lists all permissions the app needs, for example `["CAMERA"]` for an app that takes pictures.

Now we can build for the platform(s) we want:

```sh
npx expo build:ios
npx expo build:android
npx expo build:web
```

After `build:web`, our static assets will be in `web-build/`, so we'd do for instance `cd web-build/ && vercel`. 

After `build:ios` or `build:android`, we upload to the app stores:

```sh
npx expo upload:ios
npx expo upload:android
```
 
Both commands walk us through the process. In each case, we'll need a developer account. Creating a developer account for uploading apps to the Google Play Store has a one-time fee of $25, and for the iOS App Store is $99/year. The iOS App Store also has a manual review process that can take a couple days.
 
So far, we've gone through the process for deploying apps for the first time. When we make updates to our app and want to redeploy, there are two different ways to do it, depending on what types of changes we made. 

If we made changes to the version of Expo or to [certain fields](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/publishing/#some-native-configuration-cant-be-updated-by) in `app.json`, like `name`, `icon`, `splash`, `ios`, `android`, etc., then we need to re-run the build and upload commands. 

However, if we've only changed JavaScript or other assets (besides the `icon` and `splash` images), all we need to do is run `expo publish`! This command uploads our code and assets to the Expo cloud and CDN. Whenever a user opens our app, it will check Expo's cloud for a new version of our code to download and run. We can configure in `aap.json` whether Expo waits for the new version to arrive before starting the app. We currently have it set to not wait:
 
`app.json`
 
```json
{
  "expo": {
    ...
    "fallbackToCacheTimeout": 0
  }
}
```

So when the user opens the app, the version of the app code that's on the device will run. The new version will be downloaded in the background and used the next time the app is opened. If we set `"fallbackToCacheTimeout": 30000` (30 seconds, the default value), then this will happen:

- User opens app and sees splash screen.
- App checks Expo cloud for new version.
  - If there's no new version, the current version will run and the splash screen is removed.
  - If there's a new version:
    - The new version is downloaded.
      - If downloading takes less than 30 seconds, the new version is run.
      - If it takes more than 30 seconds, the old version is run.
    - The splash screen is removed.
