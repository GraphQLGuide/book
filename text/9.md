# Chapter 9: iOS

[Apollo iOS](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/) is a GraphQL library for native iOS apps. It generates query-specific Swift types and does normalized caching. It’s currently undergoing a rewrite that will change the API and how code generation works, so we’re holding off on this chapter until it’s released (hopefully by Q3 2021). Once it’s ready, we’ll email the updated version of the book to you at the address on your GitHub account. If you’d like to be join the technical review of this chapter and be the first to read it, please let us know at authors@graphql.guide!

If you’d like to start with Apollo iOS right now, we recommend going through [their tutorial](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/tutorial/tutorial-introduction/) and reading [the docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/downloading-schema/).
