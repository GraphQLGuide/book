# Who is this book for?

This book is for most programmers. If you write software that fetches data from a server, or you write server code that provides data to others, this book is for you. It‚Äôs particularly relevant to frontend and backend web and mobile developers. If you don‚Äôt know modern JavaScript, we recommend [learning that first](bg.md#javascript), but it‚Äôs not necessary. For example, if you only know Ruby, you can likely follow the JavaScript server code in Chapter 11 well enough to learn the important concepts of a GraphQL server, most of which will apply to using the `graphql` gem in your Ruby server code.

This book will be especially poignant to these groups of people:

- Backend devs who work on REST APIs and who:
  - write a lot of similar code to fetch data and format it into JSON,
  - maintain view- or device-specific endpoints, or
  - have multiple APIs that use overlapping business data.
- Frontend devs who either: 
  - don‚Äôt use a caching library, and manually keep track of what data has already been fetched from the server, or 
  - use a cache, and write a lot of code to fetch data over REST and put it in the cache (we‚Äôre looking at you, Reduxers üëÄüòÑ).

# Background

We have a [Background](bg.md) chapter that provides concise introductions to various background topics. You‚Äôre welcome to either look through them now or individually as you go along‚Äîat the beginning of a section, you‚Äôll find a list of topics it assumes knowledge of, like the [Anywhere: HTTP](5.md#anywhere-http) section, which has two listed:

> Background: [HTTP](bg.md#http), [JSON](bg.md#json)

Here‚Äôs a full list of the topics:

* [JavaScript](bg.md#javascript)
* [JavaScript classes](bg.md#javascript-classes)
* [JSON](bg.md#json)
* [Git](bg.md#git)
* [Node & npm & nvm](bg.md#node-&-npm-&-nvm)
* [HTTP](bg.md#http)
* [Server](bg.md#server)
* [MongoDB](bg.md#mongodb)
* [SPA](bg.md#spa)
* [SSR](bg.md#ssr)
* [React](bg.md#react)
* [Latency](bg.md#latency)
* [Webhooks](bg.md#webhooks)  
* [Testing](bg.md#testing)  
* [Continuous integration](bg.md#continuous-integration)
* [Authentication](bg.md#authentication)
  * [Tokens vs. sessions](bg.md#tokens-vs-sessions)
  * [localStorage vs. cookies](bg.md#localstorage-vs-cookies)
* [Browser performance](bg.md#browser-performance)

Some, like *Git* and *Node*, are necessary for following along with the coding. Others, like *Tokens vs. sessions*, are nice to know, but not necessary.

# The book

While this book is great when read cover-to-cover, it‚Äôs organized as a reference text, so you can also use it to look up a specific topic. For instance, if you‚Äôre familiar with most GraphQL types but want to learn about Unions, you can look them up in the Table of Contents under Chapter 3: Type System‚Äî[Section 9: Unions](3.md#unions). Or if you‚Äôre already doing basic queries in your React app, and you want to implement infinite scrolling, you can look it up under Chapter 6: React‚ÄîSection 5: Advanced querying‚Äî[Paginating](6.md#paginating).

[Chapter 1](1.md) introduces GraphQL and shows why it‚Äôs better than REST.

Chapters [2](2.md) and [3](3.md) explain the language itself and its type system.

[Chapter 4](4.md) goes in depth on how a GraphQL server responds to a query. It‚Äôs great for a full understanding of the technology, but you don‚Äôt *need* to know it unless you‚Äôre contributing to a GraphQL server library. So it‚Äôs totally fine to skip this‚Äîyou‚Äôll still understand everything if you go straight to [Chapter 11](11.md), the practical server-coding chapter.

[Chapter 5: Client Dev](5.md) is the first of the coding chapters, and introduces common concepts among client libraries. Then we have a chapter for each library:

- [Chapter 6: React](6.md)
- [Chapter 7: Vue](7.md)
- [Chapter 8: React Native](8.md)
- [Chapter 9: iOS](9.md)
- [Chapter 10: Android](10.md)

[Chapter 11](11.md) is our looooong server-coding chapter ü§ì. All of the examples are in Node with the `apollo-server-express` library, but almost all of the concepts can be applied to [other languages‚Äô GraphQL libraries](11.md).

# The code

We intersperse blocks of code throughout the text. When we add code to a file that we‚Äôve shown previously, we often just display the additions and some context, with ellipses (`...`) in place of existing code. These additions will be clearest if you read the book with the code open in another window. Further, we believe humans usually learn better if they write things out themselves, so we encourage you to write out the code for each step, and get it working on your computer before moving on to the next step.

We recommend using Chrome and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Code snippets are better formatted and sized in the PDF version of the book. If you‚Äôre reading this in EPUB or MOBI format on your phone, turning sideways into landscape mode will help reduce code snippet wrapping.

## Git

In Chapters 6‚Äì11, you‚Äôll learn through writing an app, step by step. Each chapter has its own repository. Each step has a branch in that repo, for example branch `0` is the starter template, branch `1` has the code you write in step 1, etc. The branches we link to in the text also have a version number, and have the format: `[step]_[version]`. When this version of the Guide was published, the version of the Chapter 6 code was `0.1.0`, so step 1 linked to branch `1_0.1.0`. The current version of the code is `0.2.0`, so step 1 links to `1_0.2.0`.

If you skip the beginning of Chapter 6 and go straight to the [Listing reviews](6.md#listing-reviews) section, it says to start with step 9 (`9_0.2.0`). So we can look at the app in that state with these terminal commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/GraphQLGuide/guide.git
cd guide/
git checkout 9_0.2.0
npm install
npm start
```

> Check out the [git](bg.md#git) and [npm](bg.md#npm) background sections if you‚Äôre unfamiliar with these commands.

If we get stuck, we can look at the diff between step 9 and step 10 with GitHub‚Äôs compare feature:

`github.com/[repository]/compare/[tag 1]...[tag 2]`

which in our case would be:

[`github.com/GraphQLGuide/guide/compare/9_0.2.0...10_0.2.0`](https://github.com/GraphQLGuide/guide/compare/9_0.2.0...10_0.2.0)

We can also see the solution to the current step by checking out the next step:

```sh
git checkout 10_0.2.0
npm start
```

## Formatting

All the JavaScript code is [ES2016](bg.md#javascript) and formatted with [prettier](https://prettier.io/) with two [settings](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html):

`.prettierrc`

```
singleQuote: true
semi: false
```

Which means `'` instead of `"` for string literals and no unnecessary semicolons.

# Resources
