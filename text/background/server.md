# Server

The term *server* may refer to:

1. A computer connected to a network (usually the internet).
2. A process running on that computer that listens to one or more ports.
3. The group of computers/processes that share the responsibility of handling requests.

In web development, servers are usually either static file servers (which serve files like our HTML, images, and JS bundle), application (app) servers (the ones that power our API and that the client talks to), or database servers. *Server-side* either means app servers or everything thatâ€™s not the client-side (including file, app, and database servers, as well as any other servers they talk to).
