# SPA

An [SPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) (single-page application) is a website that keeps the same page loaded for the duration of the userâ€™s session. Instead of a traditional website, in which every link or button that is clicked causes an [HTTP request](http.md) to be sent to the server and a new HTML page to be loaded, there is a single HTML page, and JavaScript changes the page to show different views. React, Angular, and Vue are all JS libraries for making SPAs (often called *view libraries*).
