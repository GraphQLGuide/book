GraphQL can be used between any two computers, such as from a web browser to a server or between two servers. Any computer with a network
connection can send a GraphQL request, and any computer with an IP address on
that network can receive that request and send back a response. Most software
written these days follows the
[clientâ€“server model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model),
in which one computer is always providing a service (a **server**), and another
computer is always requesting the service (a **client**, such as a web browser or mobile app). In a GraphQL clientâ€“server model, the client
makes GraphQL requests, and the server provides the service of responding to
those requests. Weâ€™ll code GraphQL clients in the next few chapters and a GraphQL server
in the [last](../server/index.md).

First weâ€™ll make simple HTTP requests, which we can do from any computer. Most
application clients are web browsers or mobile apps, so after HTTP,
weâ€™ll use the best web and mobile GraphQL libraries to create full-featured
clients. The two web view layers weâ€™ll be covering are React and Vue, and
weâ€™ll use their most popular GraphQL libraries, which are
[`@apollo/client`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) and
[`vue-apollo`](https://github.com/akryum/vue-apollo#table-of-contents/). The best mobile
libraries are [`Apollo iOS`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/),
[`Apollo-Android`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android), and
[`@apollo/client`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) for React
Native.

For each type of client and the server, weâ€™ll go through building an app for reading this book ðŸ˜„.
