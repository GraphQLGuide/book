# Preface

ðŸ‘‹ Hello there, dear reader ðŸ˜ƒ. Welcome to the Guide! We are John and Loren, your authors. John created jQuery, and Loren is slightly less famous but writes good ðŸ‘Œ. Weâ€™re here to tell you about GraphQL, the system we believe will eclipse REST as the best way to fetch data from servers. Weâ€™ll get into why in Chapter 1, but for now, hereâ€™s the story of this book:

GraphQL was released in mid 2015, and its adoption has been accelerating ever since. In 2016, Github [switched its API](https://githubengineering.com/the-github-graphql-api/) from REST to GraphQL. In 2017, AWS launched a GraphQL-based [platform](https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/) for building apps. Both [npm](https://twitter.com/seldo/status/950794461235130368) and the [State of JavaScript survey](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/i-just-asked-23-000-developers-what-they-think-of-javascript-heres-what-i-learned-9a06b61998fa) named 2018 the year of GraphQL. John and Loren both realized early on that A) GraphQL was going to be very important for app development, and B) a great book on GraphQL didnâ€™t yet exist! We each decided independently to write one, but then we found each other andâ€”over schnitzel at a biergarten in Brooklynâ€”decided to join forces.

Weâ€™re writing the complete reference: what GraphQL is, why to use it, and most importantly, how to use itâ€”on the server, in the browser, on mobile, with React, React Native, Vue, Node, Kotlin, and Swift. Weâ€™ll take you step-by-step through building an app, so you can see the practical need behind each part of GraphQL. Weâ€™re doing it as an ebook so we can always keep it up to date. A physical book would quickly fall behind best practices in such a fast-moving space.

Weâ€™d like to thank everyone who helped out with this book, including our technical reviewers Tom Coleman, Brad Crispin, Abhi Aiyer, Oleksandr Bordun, Heather Armstrong, Justin Krup, Melek Hakim, Kamal Radharamanan, Lewi Gilamichael, and Enno Thoma, our designer Genki Hagata, and our copy editors Rachel Lake, Lauren Itzla, and Paul Ramshaw. Weâ€™d also like to thank those who wrote the libraries on which this book is based, especially the GraphQL and Apollo communities.

If youâ€™d like to improve this resource for those who read after you (or your future selves! ðŸ˜„), we welcome your suggestions in the form of GitHub issues or PRs on the [book text repo](https://github.com/GraphQLGuide/book) and the [code repo](https://github.com/GraphQLGuide/guide).

Weâ€™ve found that building software with GraphQL is less difficult and more fun, and we think youâ€™ll be similarly impressed. We hope you enjoy ðŸ¤—.
