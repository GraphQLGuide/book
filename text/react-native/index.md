Background: [Mobile apps](../background/mobile-apps.md), [React Native](../background/mobile-apps.md#react-native)

In this chapter, we’ll build a universal React Native app with Expo. (For more on React Native, *universal* apps, and Expo, check out the [background section](../background/mobile-apps.md#react-native).) We’ll use the same Apollo Client library and API that we used in the extensive [React chapter](../react/index.md), so for most things, refer to that chapter. Here, we’ll just get a small example of writing and running a React Native app with a couple screens and GraphQL queries. The app will display the table of contents of the Guide—the home screen will display the chapters, and selecting a chapter will display a list of its sections.
