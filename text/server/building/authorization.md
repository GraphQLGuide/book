## Authorization

> If youâ€™re jumping in here, `git checkout 10_0.2.0` (tag [10_0.2.0](https://github.com/GraphQLGuide/guide-api/tree/10_0.2.0), or compare [10...11](https://github.com/GraphQLGuide/guide-api/compare/10_0.2.0...11_0.2.0))

In this section weâ€™ll implement an authorization check for a field on the `User` type. Later, in the [Error checking](#error-checking) section, weâ€™ll talk about how to find the places we need to do authorization checks.

Letâ€™s first add a new `user` query for fetching a single user by id:

[`src/schema/User.graphql`](https://github.com/GraphQLGuide/guide-api/compare/10_0.2.0...11_0.2.0)

```gql
extend type Query {
  me: User
  user(id: ID!): User
}
```

[`src/resolvers/User.js`](https://github.com/GraphQLGuide/guide-api/compare/10_0.2.0...11_0.2.0)

```js
import { ObjectId } from 'mongodb'

export default {
  Query: {
    me: (_, __, context) => context.user,
    user: (_, { id }, { dataSources }) =>
      dataSources.users.findOneById(ObjectId(id))
  },
  User: ...
  Mutation: ...
```

We have to turn the `id` string we receive as an argument into an `ObjectId` before calling `findOneById()`. The alternative would be to create an `ObjID` [custom scalar](#custom-scalars) that parsed string arguments into `ObjectId` objects, and then if we changed the argument type from `ID` to `ObjID`, then the `id` argument would be an `ObjectId` object by the time it reached our resolver, and we could call `findOneById()` directly:

```gql
extend type Query {
  me: User
  user(id: ObjID!): User
}
```

```js
    user: (_, { id }, { dataSources }) =>
      dataSources.users.findOneById(id)
```

```js
import { GraphQLScalarType } from 'graphql'
import { ObjectId } from 'mongodb'

export default {
  ObjID: new GraphQLScalarType({
    name: 'ObjID',
    description: ...
    parseValue: value => ObjectId(value),
    parseLiteral: ast => ObjectId(ast.value),
    serialize: objectId => objectId.toString()
  })
}
```

Letâ€™s try our new `user` query:

![user query](../../img/user-query.png)

We might now notice an issue. This query works without being logged in (i.e., including an authorization header), and it returns the userâ€™s email address. Similarly, we can query `{ reviews { author { email } } }` without being logged in. Our users would probably prefer their email addresses to not be publicly available! ðŸ˜„

There are a few possible ways to solve this issue:

1. We could remove the `email` field from the `User` type. However, it would be nice to be able to show users their own email address on their profile page.
2. We could check whether the user is fetching their own email. 

We could do the check in three places:

- **Resolver:** we just add an if statement to the beginning of a `User.email` resolver function.
- **Data source:** this doesnâ€™t have the granularity of the `User.email` resolver. If we threw an error in the data source method, the client wouldnâ€™t get any of the userâ€™s data. Doing authorization checks in data sources works well for preventing access to whole objects: for instance, if we wanted to prevent clients from fetching any user but their own. It works particularly well when there are multiple places in the schema the user can be accessed from. Instead of doing the check both in `Query.user` and `Review.author`, we can do it once in the `findOneById()` method of the `Users` data source.
- **Schema:** we can add a [custom directive](https://blog.apollographql.com/reusable-graphql-schema-directives-131fb3a177d1) like @isCurrentUser:

```gql
type User {
  id: ID!
  firstName: String!
  lastName: String!
  email: String! @isCurrentUser
  ...
}
```

(And weâ€™d make more directives for other authorization checks, like `@isLoggedIn` to deny access to a field from anonymous clients or `@isAdmin` to only allow admins to access a field.)

Wherever we do the check, when the user being requested doesnâ€™t match the logged-in user, we could either:

- Throw an error.
- Return `null`. The upside is itâ€™s easier for clients to handle than an error. (For example, if they query for 20 reviews with their authors, theyâ€™d get 20 errors to sort through.) The downside is they donâ€™t know why theyâ€™re getting a `null` responseâ€”they might think the user just doesnâ€™t have an email.
- Use a union type that combines the normal result with the error result, like:

```gql
union EmailResult = Email | Forbidden

type Email {
  address: String!
  verified: Boolean!
}

type Forbidden {
  message: String!
}

type User {
  id: ID!
  firstName: String!
  lastName: String!
  email: EmailResult!
  ...
}
```

Weâ€™ll cover [union errors](#union-errors) in the next section. 

In this case, letâ€™s do the check in a resolver and throw an error. We currently donâ€™t have a resolver for `User.email`, because Apollo Server just uses the email property on the user object. It does the equivalent of this tiny resolver:

```js
{
  User: {
    email: user => user.email
    ...
  }
}
```

When we provide our own resolver, Apollo Server will call our resolver instead of automatically returning `user.email`. Hereâ€™s what our resolver looks like:

[`src/resolvers/User.js`](https://github.com/GraphQLGuide/guide-api/compare/10_0.2.0...11_0.2.0)

```js
import { ForbiddenError } from 'apollo-server'

export default {
  Query: {
    me: (_, __, context) => context.user,
    user: (_, { id }, { dataSources }) =>
      dataSources.users.findOneById(ObjectId(id))
  },
  User: {
    id: ({ _id }) => _id,
    email(user, _, { user: currentUser }) {
      if (!currentUser || !user._id.equals(currentUser._id)) {
        throw new ForbiddenError(`cannot access othersâ€™ emails`)
      }

      return user.email
    },
    ...
  },
  Mutation: ...
}
```

Weâ€™d have a naming conflict if we destructured `user` from context, so we assign to a new variable name `currentUser`. First we test whether thereâ€™s any user at all, and then we test whether itâ€™s the same user. In the next section weâ€™ll see what the error looks like to the client! ðŸ‘€
