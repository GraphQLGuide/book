## Apollo federation

In the [Introduction](introduction.md) to this chapter, we talk about microservices versus monoliths. If we go down the microservice route, then we recommend doing so with Apollo federation. 

> An alternative that supports Subscriptions is [GraphQL Tools schema stitching](https://www.graphql-tools.com/docs/stitch-combining-schemas/). For further differences between the two, see [this article](https://product.voxmedia.com/2020/11/2/21494865/to-federate-or-stitch-a-graphql-gateway-revisited).

This chapter is included in the Pro edition of the book:
