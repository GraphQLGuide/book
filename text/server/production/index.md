# Production

Once our GraphQL server code works and we want others (or our client code) to use it, we need to put it into production. This section contains the basic steps:

- [Deploying our code](deployment.md)
- [Setting up our databases](database-hosting.md)
- [Querying in production](querying-in-production.md)
- [Gathering analytics](analytics.md)
- [Tracking errors](error-reporting.md)

And in the last part of the chapter, [Extended topics](../extended-topics/index.md), we cover additional topics relevant to production, including [security](../extended-topics/security.md) and [performance](../extended-topics/performance.md).
