# Testing

Background: [Testing](../../background/testing.md)

* [Static testing](static-tests.md)
* [Review integration tests](review-integration-tests.md)
* [Code coverage](code-coverage.md)
* [User integration tests](user-integration-tests.md)
* [Unit tests](unit-tests.md)
* [End-to-end tests](end-to-end-tests.md)

In the Background chapter we go over [mocking](../../background/testing.md#mocking) and [which types of tests](../../background/testing.md#types-of-tests) are best to write. 

In this section we’ll start out by setting up static testing. Next we’ll write integration tests for our review operations. Then we’ll check how much of the code we’ve tested using a code coverage tool. Next we’ll fill in some of the coverage gaps with more integration tests and unit tests. Finally, we’ll write an end-to-end test.
